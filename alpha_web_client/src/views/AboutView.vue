        <h1>Alpha - The OpenSource learning platform</h1>
        <p>
            Alpha is a set of open source tools to store and learn study material,
            mainly directed at school topics such as vocabulary.
            There is also a fun collaborative game feature called KaYeet?! (for no
            particular reason at all).
        </p>


        <h2>Some random number: {{ counter.count }}</h2>
        <button @click="counter.count++">Ooo nice button to clicki clicki</button>
